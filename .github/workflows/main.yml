# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run.

  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the master branch

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
